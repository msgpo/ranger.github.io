# Relocated website

The URL for the ranger website has changed from [http://ranger.nongnu.org](http://ranger.nongnu.org) to [https://ranger.github.io](https://ranger.github.io).  An automatic redirect has been set up.  Reasons for the move are:

* nongnu.org forces the use of CVS to update the website
* With GitHub's pull requests, everybody can contribute more easily to the website
* GitHub offers HTTPS
